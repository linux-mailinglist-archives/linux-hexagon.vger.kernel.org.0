Hello Dear.

Please forgive me for stressing you with my predicaments as I know that thi=
s letter may come to you as big surprise.  Actually, I came across your E-m=
ail from my personal search afterward I decided to email you directly belie=
ving that you will be honest to fulfill my final wish before i die. Meanwhi=
le, I am Mrs.Romane Matheo, 62 years old, from France, and I am  suffering =
from a long time cancer and from all indication my condition is really dete=
riorating as my doctors have confirmed and courageously Advised me that I m=
ay not live beyond two months from now for the reason that my tumor has rea=
ched a  critical stage which has defiled all forms of medical treatment, As=
 a matter of fact, registered nurse by profession while my  husband was dea=
ling on Gold Dust and Gold Dory Bars till his sudden death the year 2018 th=
en I took over his business till date. In fact, at this moment I have a dep=
osit sum of Seven million five hundred thousand US dollars[$7,500,000.00] w=
ith one of the leading bank but unfortunately I cannot visit the bank since=
 I=E2=80=99m critically sick and powerless to do anything myself but my ban=
k account officer advised me to assign any of my trustworthy relative, frie=
nds or partner with authorization letter to stand as the recipient of my mo=
ney but sorrowfully I don=E2=80=99t have any reliable relative and no child=
.

Therefore, I want you to receive the money and take 50% to take care of you=
rself and family while 50% should be use basically on humanitarian purposes=
 mostly to orphanages home, Motherless babies home, less privileged and dis=
able citizens and widows around the world. And as soon as I receive your re=
spond I shall send you the full details with my pictures, banking records a=
nd with full contacts of my banking institution to communicate them on the =
matter.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Yours Faithfully,
Mrs. Romane Matheo
