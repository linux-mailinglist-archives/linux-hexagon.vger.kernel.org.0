Greeting to you,
Please forgive me for stressing you with my predicaments and I sorry
to approach you through this media because it serves the fastest means
of communication. I came across your E-mail from my personal search
and I decided to contact you believing you will be honest to fulfill
my final wish before I die.

I am Mrs Anna Edward, 63 years, from USA, I am childless and I am
suffering from a pro-long critical cancer, my doctors confirmed I may
not live beyond two months from now as my ill health has defiled all
forms of medical treatment. Since my days are numbered, I have decided
willingly to fulfill my long-time promise to donate you the sum
($5.000.000.00) million dollars I inherited from my late husband Mr.
Edward Herbart, foreign bank account over years. I need a very honest
person who can assist in transfer of this money to his or her account
and use the funds for charity work of God while you use 50% for
yourself. I want you to know there is no risk involved; it is 100%
hitch free & safe.

If you are interested in assisting in getting this fund into your
account for a charity project to fulfill my promise before I die
please let me know immediately.

I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality as I wait for your reply.
Best Regards,
Mrs Anna Edward
